To fulfill this task, I will call the \"get_movies_by_year_for_imdb_api\" function from the IMDb API. By using this function, I can retrieve a list of movies released in the specified year. This will allow me to provide the user with the movie titles, directors, casts, and ratings for each movie. Calling this function with the appropriate arguments will help me gather the necessary information to assist the user in selecting movies for their movie night.",

One option is to use the \"get_movies_by_name_for_imdb_api\" function and search for movies with the keyword \"2020\" in their title. By doing so, I can gather a list of movies released in the specified year and provide the user with the necessary information such as titles, directors, casts, and ratings.
