By passing the argument \"searchquery\" as \"Macbook Air\", I can retrieve the desired search results. This will allow me to gather the necessary information about the product, such as its price, ratings, and availability. Additionally, I can access the product reviews for the specific product with the ID \"B08N5W4NNB\" to obtain the average rating, total ratings, and top positive and critical reviews. By using this API, I will be able to provide the user with a comprehensive overview of the Macbook Air and its reviews.",
