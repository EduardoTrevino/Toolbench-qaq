          "description": "Based on the previous action candidates, it seems that the \"hourly_for_ai_weather_by_meteosource\" function failed due to an unsubscribed error. To avoid repeating the same mistake, I should try a different approach. Instead of using the \"hourly_for_ai_weather_by_meteosource\" function, I can use the \"daily_for_ai_weather_by_meteosource\" function to get the daily weather forecast for the next 3 days. This function should provide the required information about temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and cloud cover. I will call the \"daily_for_ai_weather_by_meteosource\" function to retrieve the forecast.",

Remember:\n1.ALWAYS call \"Finish\" function at the end of the task. And the final answer should contain enough information to show to the user,If you can't handle the task, or you find that function calls always fail(the function is not valid now), use function Finish->give_up_and_restart.\n2.Do not use origin tool names, use only subfunctions' names.\nYou have access of the following tools:\n1.ai_weather_by_meteosource: Accurate hyper-local weather forecasts, powered by our cutting-edge machine learning (ML) models.
