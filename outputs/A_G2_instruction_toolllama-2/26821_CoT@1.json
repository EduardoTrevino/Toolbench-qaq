To fulfill this request, I can suggest using the \"remote_jobs_api\" tool, which allows searching for remote jobs from various sources. By calling the \"get_the_latest_remote_jobs_for_remote_jobs_api\" function, I can retrieve the latest remote job listings. This API call with no arguments will provide a list of remote jobs, and I can further filter the results based on the user's desired salary range. Additionally, the user mentioned generating a cover letter for a specific job opportunity. Although the current API call does not directly address this, I can keep it in mind for future steps and explore the available tools to assist with generating a cover letter using AI-powered resume generation.",
