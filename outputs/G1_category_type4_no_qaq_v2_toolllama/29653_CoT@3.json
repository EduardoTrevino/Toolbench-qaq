The first subfunction is \"get_1_shoot_thumbnail_for_pagepeeker\" which generates a single image thumbnail, and the second subfunction is \"get_2_thumbnail_ready_for_pagepeeker\" which generates two images thumbnails in different sizes.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use these subfunctions:\n\n1. Call the \"get_1_shoot_thumbnail_for_pagepeeker\" subfunction with the following arguments:\n   - size: \"s\" (for a small thumbnail)\n   - url: [URL of the webpage]\n\n2. Call the \"get_2_thumbnail_ready_for_pagepeeker\" subfunction with the following arguments:\n   - size: [size of the thumbnail]\n   - url: [URL of the webpage]\n\n3. Once the call is successful, you will receive the generated thumbnails. You can download them and use them for your clients' websites.\n\nLet me know if you need any further assistance!",

The first subfunction is \"get_1_shoot_thumbnail_for_pagepeeker\" which generates a single image thumbnail, and the second subfunction is \"get_2_thumbnail_ready_for_pagepeeker\" which generates two images thumbnails in different sizes.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use these subfunctions:\n\n1. Call the \"get_1_shoot_thumbnail_for_pagepeeker\" subfunction with the following arguments:\n   - size: \"s\" (for a small thumbnail)\n   - url: [URL of the webpage]\n\n2. Call the \"get_2_thumbnail_ready_for_pagepeeker\" subfunction with the following arguments:\n   - size: [size of the thumbnail]\n   - url: [URL of the webpage]\n\n3. Once the call is successful, you will receive the generated thumbnails. You can download them and use them for your clients' websites.\n\nLet me know if you need any further assistance!",

          "content": "Sure! I can suggest using the \"pagepeeker\" API for generating thumbnails. It has two subfunctions that can help you create thumbnails in different sizes. The first subfunction is \"get_1_shoot_thumbnail_for_pagepeeker\" which generates a single image thumbnail, and the second subfunction is \"get_2_thumbnail_ready_for_pagepeeker\" which generates two images thumbnails in different sizes.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use these subfunctions:\n\n1. Call the \"get_1_shoot_thumbnail_for_pagepeeker\" subfunction with the following arguments:\n   - size: \"s\" (for a small thumbnail)\n   - url: [URL of the webpage]\n\n2. Call the \"get_2_thumbnail_ready_for_pagepeeker\" subfunction with the following arguments:\n   - size: [size of the thumbnail]\n   - url: [URL of the webpage]\n\n3. Once the call is successful, you will receive the generated thumbnails. You can download them and use them for your clients' websites.\n\nLet me know if you need any further assistance!",
