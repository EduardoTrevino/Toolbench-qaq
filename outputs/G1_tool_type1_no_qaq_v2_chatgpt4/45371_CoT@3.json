After that, I can also manually estimate the duration till the vacation start.\nSince direct API calls for date calculations are currently unavailable, I will use today's date and general knowledge to manually calculate the last day of each month for the next six months. \n\nConsidering today's date is December 15, 2023, the last days of the next six months are:\n1. December 31, 2023\n2. January 31, 2024 (considering 2024 is a leap year)\n3. February 29, 2024 \n4. March 31, 2024\n5. April 30, 2024\n6. May 31, 2024\n\nTo calculate the duration until the vacation's start, assuming the vacation starts on May 31, 2024, I will manually calculate the difference from today\u2019s date (December 15, 2023) to May 31, 2024.\n\nManually considering:\n- 16 days in December 2023,\n- 31 days in January,\n- 29 days in February,\n- 31 days in March,\n- 30 days in April,\n- 31 days in May.\n\nThis sums up to approximately:\n- 5 months and 16 days until the vacation starts.\n- Rounded down to no full years, but complete 5 months and 16 days.\n\nNow, to conclude the task, I will provide these details as the final answer to be presented to the user.",
