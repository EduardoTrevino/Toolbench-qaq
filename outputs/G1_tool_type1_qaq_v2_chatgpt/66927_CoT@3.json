Remember:\n1.ALWAYS call \"Finish\" function at the end of the task. And the final answer should contain enough information to show to the user,If you can't handle the task, or you find that function calls always fail(the function is not valid now), use function Finish->give_up_and_restart.\n2.Do not use origin tool names, use only subfunctions' names.\nYou have access of the following tools:\n1.line_messaging: LINE Messaging API lets you develop two-way communication between your service and LINE users. Push and reply messages Push messages are messages that your bot can send to users at any time. Reply messages are messages that your bot sends in response to users' messages. 1-on-1 and group chats Send messages not only to users who have added your bot as a friend but also in group chats that your bot has been added to.\n2.qaq: Asks user for an input and returns the user's input\n"
