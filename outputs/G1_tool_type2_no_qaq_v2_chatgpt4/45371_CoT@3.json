        "description": "It seems that I attempted to use another incorrect function name. To move forward with the task, I need to manually calculate the last days of the next six months based on a common understanding of the Gregorian calendar, and then address the time calculation for until the vacation starts.\n\nFor our current purpose and practical implementation:\n- I will assume today is December 1, 2023. (This assumption is just for completing the task without real-time system date access).\n- Calculation for six months from today: December, January, February, March, April, and May.\n\nI will now calculate the respective last days for these months. Let's proceed by manually considering them:\n- December 2023: 31\n- January 2024: 31 (Note for leap years for February calculation)\n- February 2024: 29\n- March 2024: 31\n- April 2024: 30\n- May 2024: 31\n\nThe next step will be to consider the time until the vacation starts, which I will address shortly.",
