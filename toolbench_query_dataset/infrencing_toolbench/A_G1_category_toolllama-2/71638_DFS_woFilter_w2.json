It offers a wide range of features for efficient development and debugging. With Judge0, developers can easily create and run code in various programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, C++, and many more.\n\nTo get started with Judge0, you can visit their official website and explore the documentation to learn more about the available features and how to use them effectively for your projects.\n\nUnfortunately, since I don't have access to the specific language details and source files for Judge0, I am unable to provide the information you requested.

Since all previous attempts to access the API have failed, I will try a different approach. Instead of using the API, I will provide a general overview of Judge0 and its features based on my knowledge as an AI assistant.\n\nJudge0 is a powerful online code execution system that allows software developers to run code, test, and debug their projects in a simulated environment. It offers a wide range of features for efficient development and debugging. With Judge0, developers can easily create and run code in various programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, C++, and many more.\n\nTo get started with Judge0, you can visit their official website and explore the documentation to learn more about the available features and how to use them effectively for your projects.\n\nUnfortunately, since I don't have access to the specific language details and source files for Judge0, I am unable to provide the information you requested. However, you can explore the Judge0 platform directly to find the source file and run command for the language with ID 10.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need assistance with any other topic, please let me know!",
