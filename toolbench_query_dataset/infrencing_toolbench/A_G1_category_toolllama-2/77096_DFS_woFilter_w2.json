To fulfill this request, I will call the \"get_movies_by_year_for_imdb_api\" function from the IMDb API with the argument specifying the year as 80s. By doing so, I can retrieve a list of movies released in the 80s along with their directors and cast members. This will allow me to provide the user with the desired information for their movie trivia night.",

With this API, you can search for movies by title, year, directors, and cast. Retrieve detailed information about each movie, including ratings, genres, and more. By integrating our API into your applications or services, you can offer users an enhanced movie search and discovery experience, opening up exciting possibilities for building movie-related platforms.\n"
