By calling the \"article_api_for_diffbot\" function with the argument \"url\" set to \"https://example.com/news-article-1\", I can retrieve the desired information from the specified news article webpage.

Remember:\n1.ALWAYS call \"Finish\" function at the end of the task. And the final answer should contain enough information to show to the user,If you can't handle the task, or you find that function calls always fail(the function is not valid now), use function Finish->give_up_and_restart.\n2.Do not use origin tool names, use only subfunctions' names.\nYou have access of the following tools:\n1.diffbot: Diffbot extracts data from web pages automatically and returns structured JSON. For example, our Article API returns an article's title, author, date and full-text. Use the web as your database!\r\rWe use computer vision, machine learning and natural language processing to add structure to just about any web page.\n"
