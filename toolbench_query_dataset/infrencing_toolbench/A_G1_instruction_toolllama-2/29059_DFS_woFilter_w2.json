One option is to use the airport_departues_for_flight_fare_search function to get the departures from London on the specific date. By calling this function with the arguments \"airportcode\" set to \"London\" and \"date\" set to \"2022-12-15\", I can retrieve the departures from London on the specified date. Although I couldn't fetch the flight options, I can still assist the user by providing them with the necessary information about airports.",
