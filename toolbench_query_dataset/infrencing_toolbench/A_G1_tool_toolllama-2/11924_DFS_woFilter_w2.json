Endpoint: metric_kilograms_for_body_mass_index_bmi_calculator\n   Parameters: weight (int) - The weight of the individual in kilograms (kgs), height (int) - The height of the individual in meters (m)\n   This endpoint calculates the BMI using the metric system.\n\n2. Endpoint: imperial_pounds_for_body_mass_index_bmi_calculator\n   Parameters: weight (int) - The weight of the individual in pounds (lbs), height (int) - The height of the individual in inches (in)\n   This endpoint calculates the BMI using the imperial measurement system.\n\n3. Endpoint: weight_category_for_body_mass_index_bmi_calculator\n   Parameters: bmi (int) - The BMI value of the individual\n   This endpoint retrieves the weight category of the individual based on their BMI.\n\nPlease note that these endpoints and parameters are based on the BMI calculation API provided by the developer.
