Since we are unable to use the date calculator API, we need to find an alternative solution to obtain the last day of each month for the next six months.\n\nOne possible approach is to manually calculate the end dates by considering the number of months and excluding the weekends. We can use a loop to iterate over the months and increment the month number each time we call the function.\n\nHere is the modified plan:\n1. Initialize a variable to represent the number of months in the future.\n2. Use a loop to iterate over the months, starting from the present day.\n3. Increment the month number by 1 and call the function to get the last day of each month.\n4. Store the last day of each month in a list.\n5. After looping through all the months, call the \"Finish\" function to provide the final answer.\n\nLet's execute this plan.",
