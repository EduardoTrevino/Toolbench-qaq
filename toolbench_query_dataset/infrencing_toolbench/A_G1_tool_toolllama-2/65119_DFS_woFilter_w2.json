To avoid this error, I will try to use the \"offerinfo_for_google_jobs\" function instead of \"searchoffers_for_google_jobs\". This function directly fetches the details of each offer, including the job description, requirements, and company information. I will call the \"offerinfo_for_google_jobs\" function with the keyword \"Frankfurt\" and the location \"Frankfurt\".",
          "function_call": {
            "name": "offerinfo_for_google_jobs",
            "arguments": "{\n  \"joburl\": \"https://www.google.com/search?q=jobs+in+Frankfurt\"\n}"
          }
        },
        {
          "role": "function",
          "name": "offerinfo_for_google_jobs",
          "content": "{\"error\": \"Unsubscribed error...\", \"response\": \"{'message': 'You are not subscribed to this API.'}\"}"
        },
        {
          "role": "assistant",
          "content": "ize, but it seems that there is an issue with the API subscription, and I am unable to fetch the job offers and their details at the moment. I will need to restart the task.",

        }
      ]
    ],
    "query": "Can you help me search for job offers in Frankfurt? I am interested in the URLs of the latest offers. Additionally, please fetch the details of each offer, including the job description, requirements, and company information."
